## Learning Points

This project was a great opportunity to practice building a full-stack application using the MVC paradigm. I learned how to use Handlebars.js to render dynamic HTML pages, and how to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. However I think I would benefit from reworking this application from the start, as I feel I have a better understanding of how to structure the code and how to use the various technologies involved.
